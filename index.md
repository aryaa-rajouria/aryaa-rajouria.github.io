As a doctoral student in Sociology at the University of Washington-Seattle and affiliate with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research's Population, Health, and Data Science program, my research examines how communities in the Global South navigate migration decisions in response to environmental disasters.

Embracing methodological plurality, I integrate qualitative, quantitative, and computational approaches to address complex social phenomena at the intersections of social demography, migration studies, population health, and climate vulnerability. My previous work has explored connections between migration, mental health outcomes, and global conceptions of race and ethnicity. I also contribute to research on creating effective STEM learning environments.

I hold an MA in Sociology with a certificate in Demography and Ecology from the University of Washington and a BA in International Relations and Economics from Mount Holyoke College.
