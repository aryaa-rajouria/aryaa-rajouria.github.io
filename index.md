# About Me

I am a **doctoral student in Sociology** at the **University of Washington-Seattle**, and an **affiliate with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research** in the **Population, Health, and Data Science** program. My research examines how communities in the Global South make migration decisions in response to environmental disasters.

I embrace **methodological plurality**, integrating qualitative, quantitative, and computational approaches to address complex social issues at the intersections of **migration studies**, **population health**, **social demography**, and **climate vulnerability**. My previous work has explored the connections between migration, mental health, and global conceptions of race and ethnicity. I also contribute to research on creating effective STEM learning environments.
