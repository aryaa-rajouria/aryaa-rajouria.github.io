I am a doctoral student in Sociology at the University of Washington-Seattle, and an affiliate with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in the Population, Health, and Data Science program. My research examines how communities in the Global South make migration decisions in response to environmental disasters.

I embrace **methodological plurality**, integrating qualitative, quantitative, and computational approaches to address complex social issues at the intersections of **migration studies**, **population health**, **social demography**, and **climate vulnerability**. My previous work has explored the connections between migration, mental health, and global conceptions of race and ethnicity. I also contribute to research on creating effective STEM learning environments.

In addition to my research, I serve as an editorial assistant for [Demography](https://www.populationassociation.org/demography/editorial-team/editorial-assistant), a leading journal in the field of population studies and contribute to the [Population Dynamics Lab](https://population-dynamics-lab.csde.washington.edu), an open science forum to share, publish, and cite computational methods and empirical tools for population research.

I hold an MA in Sociology (with a certificate in Demography and Ecology) from the University of Washington-Seattle (2023), and a BA in International Relations and Economics from Mount Holyoke College (2019).
